Hereâ€™s a **polished README draft** that keeps your voice but organizes everything clearly, adds the four links, and emphasizes the **pipeline + testing** story.

# Olist Brazil E-commerce: Data Pipeline for Predictive Analysis

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates a **full data-engineering + machine-learning pipeline** on the public
[Olist Brazilian E-commerce dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/olistbr/brazilian-ecommerce).
The focus is on **production-ready data flows, cloud management, and testing**,
with modeling used primarily to validate the pipeline rather than to chase the highest accuracy.

---

## Key Highlights

* **AWS Cloud Pipeline** â€“ Raw CSVs â†’ **AWS RDS (PostgreSQL)** â†’ locally-run SQL queries â†’ upload to **Amazon S3** â†’ download to local machine for analytics and modeling.
* **SQL Feature Engineering** â€“ Recency/Frequency metrics, pricing features, and logistical variables such as `estimated_days_vs_actual`.
* **Predictive Modeling** â€“

  * **Delivery Delay**: XGBoost model predicting late deliveries.
  * **Customer Churn**: Logistic Regression and Random Forest.
    *(Models are intentionally simpleâ€”goal is pipeline reliability, not SOTA accuracy.)*
* **Data Quality Testing** â€“ Outlier flags, negative-time checks, and unit tests to validate every SQL query before export.

## Testing & Data Quality

Every SQL query was accompanied by **pytest-style checks** to guarantee accuracy before moving data downstream.
Examples:

* **Aggregation tests** â€“ revenue sums across states match overall totals.
* **Consistency tests** â€“ order counts match between joined tables.
* **Outlier detection** â€“ freight ratio > 2 or negative shipping times flagged for review.

## Pipeline Flow

```
Raw Olist CSVs
   â”‚
   â”œâ”€â–º Load to AWS RDS (PostgreSQL)
   â”‚
   â”œâ”€â–º Local SQL queries + pytest data-quality tests
   â”‚
   â”œâ”€â–º Export clean feature tables
   â”‚
   â”œâ”€â–º Upload to Amazon S3 bucket
   â”‚
   â””â”€â–º Download refined CSVs for local modeling
```

## Insights

* **Late Delivery** â€“ `distinct_sellers` emerged as the most influential predictor; orders involving multiple sellers have a higher probability of being late.
* **Customer Churn** â€“ Features reflecting **customer spending behavior** (order value, frequency) are strongest predictors of repeat purchasing, which aligns with the fact that **most Olist customers only order once**.

---

## Takeaways

* Building a **tested, cloud-based data pipeline** is just as critical as modeling.
* **SQL feature engineering + automated tests** ensure reliability and reproducibility.
* Even modest models (XGBoost, Random Forest) can surface actionable logistics and customer-behavior insights when the data pipeline is solid.
